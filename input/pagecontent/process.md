Processes of metadata management


### Metadata specification management

The metadata specifications are iterated in collaboration with the work packages that use it, and their progress is managed via issues of the GitHub repository:
- [issues regarding metadata framework](https://github.com/Xt-EHR/xt-ehr-metadata/issues)  
- [issues regarding information models](https://github.com/Xt-EHR/xt-ehr-common/issues)


The closed issues capture decisions and agreed changes, as well as escalations if needed (for example updates to the FHIR tooling and infrastructure).
